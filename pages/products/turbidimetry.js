          </div>
          <p>Vitassay FOB Turbidimetry kits for quantitative measurement of haemoglobin in human faeces (Fecal Occult Blood) using automated immunochemical analyzers.</p>
          <p><span>Colorectal cancer</span> is the second leading cause of illness and death in Western world. The screening with faecal occult blood tests is based on the concept that important target colonic neoplasm, such as earlystage cancer and large adenomatous polyps.</p>
          <p><span>Colorectal cancer</span> is also associated with local acute inflammatory reaction being visualized, in some cases, by white cell neutrophil scanning. Haemoglobin is the iron-containing oxygen-transport protein in the red blood cells of all vertebrates that may be leaked into gastrointestinal tract and then discharged with the faeces in gastrointestinal bleeding diseases.</p>
          <p>When gastrointestinal blood is lost, the stool will contain a combination of intact or nearly intact haemoglobin, intact heme and heme-derived porphyrins in amounts that depend on the site and amount of bleeding and the transit time through the gut. FOB Turbidimetry tests detect intact or nearly intact human haemoglobin, being a very specific technique for detecting loss of blood from the lower intestine.</p>

          </div>
          <p>Vitassay Calprotectin Turbidimetry kits for quantitative measurement of calprotectin in human faeces using automated immunochemical analyzers.</p>
          <p><span>Calprotectin</span>  is a 36 KDa neutrophil cytosolic protein with antimicrobial properties. Increased concentration of this protein in stool samples is tightly associated to bowel inflammation. This protein remains stable in faeces for up to 7 days at room temperature, becoming it an ideal disease marker.</p>
          <p><span>VITASSAY Calprotectin Turbidimetric</span> assay allows the quantitative determination providing sensitive, accurate and reproducible measures of human calprotectin (hCp) in faeces specimens. Test results are obtained in a very short time.</p>
          <p>The assay is based on antigen-antibody agglutination reactions between the antigen contained in the sample and the antibodies anti-antigen coated on polystyrene latex particles.</p>
          <p>Such agglutination is measured as an increase in absorbance proportional to the quantity of antigen contained in the sample.</p>

          </div>
          <p>Vitassay Pancreatic Elastase Turbidimetry kits for the for the quantitative detection of human Pancreatic elastase E1 in human stool samples.</p>
          <p>Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) is defined by a deficiency of exocrine pancreatic enzymes resulting in an inability to maintain normal digestion.</p>
          <p>EPI is one of the major complications of chronic pancreatitis that has alcohol as the main etiological cause. Human Elastase is synthetized by the acinar cells of the pancreas along with the other proteolytic enzymes, and under normal conditions. An advantage of fecal elastase 1 as a diagnostic marker is its low variability within an individual from day to day, indicating that its measurement in fecal samples is valid diagnostically.</p>
